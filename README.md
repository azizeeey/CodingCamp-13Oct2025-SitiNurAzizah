## üìú About The Project

This application allows users to efficiently manage their daily tasks. It goes beyond a simple to-do list by incorporating features like sub-tasks, progress tracking, and persistent storage. The project was developed to implement and showcase key concepts in modern front-end web development.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Task & Sub-task Management**: Add, edit, and delete main tasks and nested sub-tasks.
- **Due Dates**: Assign a due date to every task and sub-task.
- **Mark as Complete**: Toggle completion status for tasks. Parent tasks are automatically updated based on sub-task completion.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are saved to the browser's `localStorage`, so your list is preserved even after closing the tab.
- **Search & Filter**: Instantly search for tasks or filter the list by status (All, Pending, Completed).
- **Statistics Dashboard**: View a summary of total, completed, and pending tasks, along with a visual progress bar.
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Switch between a light and dark theme for comfortable viewing.
- **Confirmation Modals**: Prevents accidental deletion of tasks with a confirmation prompt.
- **Responsive Design**: A clean and adaptive layout that works on various screen sizes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This project was built using standard web technologies:

- **HTML5**: For the structure and content of the web page.
- **CSS3**: For styling, layout, and animations.
